The `Network File System` (**NFS**) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol.

`Default Port: 111,2049`

# Banner grabbing

```bash
nc -nv $IP 111
nc -nv $IP 2049
```

# Versions and Variations

While NFS protocol version 3.0 (**_NFSv3_**), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with **_NFSv4_**.

| Version | Features                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NFSv2` | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over `UDP`.                                     |
| `NFSv3` | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with `NFSv2` clients. |
| `NFSv4` | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.     |

# Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.


```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -p111,2049 $IP

# Enum with all NSE script 
sudo nmap --script=nfs* -sV -p111,2049 $IP
```

# Mounting

Once such an NFS service is discovered, it can be mounted on a local machine.

```bash
# Show available shares
showmount -e $IP

# Mounting the share
mkdir /mnt/nfs-share
sudo mount -t nfs $IP:<remote_directory> /mnt/nfs-share -o nolock
cd /mnt/nfs-share

# List username & group names
ls -l /mnt/nfs-share/

# List UIDs & GUIDs
ls -n /mnt/nfs-share/

# Unmounting the share
sudo umount /mnt/nfs-share
```

# Config files

```bash
# Default configuration
cat /etc/exports
```

# Dangerous settings

Some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure.

| `insecure`       | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                              |
| `nohide`         | If a file system is mounted beneath an exported directory, it becomes accessible without requiring a separate export entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.                                                                      |
