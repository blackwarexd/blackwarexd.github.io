R-Services are a set of tools that allow remote access and command execution between Unix hosts over `TCP/IP`. Developed by UC Berkeley, they were widely used until replaced by SSH due to security flaws. Like `Telnet`, R-Services send data unencrypted.

R-services use ports `512`, `513`, and `514`, and are accessed through `r-commands`. They are commonly used by commercial operating systems like Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.

`Default Port: 512,513,514`

```bash
nc -nv $IP 512
nc -nv $IP 513
nc -nv $IP 514
```

# Nmap
[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -p512,513,514 $IP
```

# R-commands
The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp: `remote copy`
- rexec: `remote execution`
- rlogin: `remote login`
- rsh: `remote shell`
- rwho: `remote who`
- rstat
- ruptime

Each command has its intended functionality; however, this is the most commonly abused `r-commands`.

| Command  | Service Daemon | Port | Protocol | Description                                                                                                 |
| -------- | -------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rcp`    | `rshd`         | 514  | TCP      | Copies files between local and remote systems (or remote-to-remote) without warning when overwriting files. |
| `rsh`    | `rshd`         | 514  | TCP      | Opens a remote shell without a login procedure, using trusted entries in `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts`.  |
| `rexec`  | `rexecd`       | 512  | TCP      | Runs commands on a remote machine with username/password authentication over an unencrypted network.        |
| `rlogin` | `rlogind`      | 513  | TCP      | Logs into a remote Unix host, similar to `telnet`, using trusted entries for authentication.                |

```bash
# Login with rlogin
rlogin $IP -l administrator

# Once connected, 
# this command can be use to enumerate manually.
	> rwho				# Same as (who) command in Linux
	> rusers -al $IP 	# Detailed account of all logged-in users
```

# Config files
```bash
cat /etc/hosts.equiv  # Contains a list of trusted hosts (users with trusted hosts access the system, no authentication needed.)
cat .rhosts           # Provides a per-user configuration.
```
