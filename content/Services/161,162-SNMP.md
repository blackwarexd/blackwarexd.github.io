The `Simple Network Management Protocol` (**SNMP**) is used to monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, and servers. It allows remote configuration and control using the standard protocol. The default port for SNMP is 161 (UDP), and 162 (UDP) is used for SNMP traps (alerts).

`Default Port: 161,162(traps)`

```bash
nc -nv -u $IP 161

> **SNMP** requires unique addresses for client-server communication to exchange values and monitor the network.
# MIB
The `Management Information Base` (**MIB**) is a standardized format for storing device information in a text file. It lists all queryable SNMP objects in a tree hierarchy, which each object having a unique `Object Identifier` (**OID**). MIB files, written in ASN.1 format, don't contain data but define the structure, access rights, and types of information.

# OID
An `Object Identifier` (**OID**) uniquely identifies a node in a hierarchical tree. The OID sequence, represented by numbers and separated by dots, determines the position of the node, with more specific information at deeper levels.

# Versions and Variations

| Version  | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SNMPv1` | First version, supports monitoring, configuration, and traps. Lacks authentication and encryption (`data in plain text`).                                                                               |
| `SNMPv2` | Same security as `v1`, with additional functions. The "`c`" in `v2c` stands for "`community-based`," meaning the security is based on a shared community string (`still in plain text, no encryption`). |
| `SNMPv3` | Improved security with authentication (username/password) and encryption (via `pre-shared keys`). More complex to configure than v2c.                                                                   |

# Community Strings

Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. It is important to note that many organizations are still using `SNMPv2`, as the transition to `SNMPv3` can be very complex, but the services still need to remain active.

# Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -sU -p161 $IP
```

# SNMPwalk
Retrieve a subtree of management values using SNMP GETNEXT requests

```bash
# Query SNMP data using SNMPv2c with the 'public' community string
snmpwalk -v2c -c public $IP
```

# OneSixtyOne
[onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) is a simple SNMP scanner which sends SNMP requests for the sysDescr value asynchronously with user-adjustable sending times and then logs the responses which gives the description of the software running on the device.

```bash
# Brute-force SNMP community strings using a wordlist
onesixtyone -c /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt $IP
```

# Braa
[Braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process.

```bash
# Brute-force individual OIDs for SNMP data
braa public@$IP:.1.3.6.*
```


# Config files

```bash
# Default configuration
cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
```

# Dangerous settings

Some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure.

| Settings                                         | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rwuser noauth`                                  | Grants full access to the OID tree without requiring authentication.                     |
| `rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`  | Allows full access to the OID tree from any IPv4 address, bypassing source restrictions. |
| `rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>` | Same as `rwcommunity`, but for IPv6 addresses, allowing unrestricted access.             |
