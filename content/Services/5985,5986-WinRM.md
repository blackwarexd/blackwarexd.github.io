`Default Port: 5985,5986(ssl)`

# Nmap
[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -p5985,5986 $IP
```

# NetExec
[NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) (AKA **nxc**) is a network service exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large networks.

```bash
# Get Windows version
nxc winrm $IP

# Password spraying
nxc winrm $IP -u /wordlists.txt/users.txt -p /wordlists/passwords.txt --no-bruteforce

# Execute command with AUTHENTICATION
nxc winrm $IP -u administrator -p password123 -x "whoami"
```

# Evil-WinRM
[Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) is the ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting.
```bash
evil-winrm -i $IP -u Administrator -p password123       # Login
evil-winrm -S -c pub.key -k decrypted_priv.key -i $IP   # Login (CERTIFICATES/SSL)
```

# Metasploit Framework
[Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) is an open source platform that supports vulnerability research, exploit development, and the creation of custom security tools.

```bash
auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods	# Checks the authentication methods
auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd           # Execute command
auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login         # Brute-forcing login

# Execute payload (required AUTHENTICATION)
# If you can't execute it [BUG]; make sure to `set FORCE_VBS true`
