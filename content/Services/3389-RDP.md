`Default Port: 3389`

```bash
nc -nv $IP 3389
```

# Nmap
[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -p3389 $IP

# Enum RDP with all NSE
sudo nmap -p3389 -sV --script=rdp* $IP
```

# RDP Security Check
Perl [script](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check) to enumerate security settings of an RDP Service (AKA Terminal Services).
```bash
rdp-sec-check.pl $IP
```

# XfreeRDP
XfreeRDP is an X11 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client which is part of the [FreeRDP](https://www.freerdp.com/) project.
```bash
# Connect with AUTHENTICATION
xfreerdp /u:Administrator /p:password123 /v:$IP:$PORT /cert:ignore

# Connect with AUTHENTICATION (mount Linux folder for file transfer)
# connect to \\tsclient\ for accessing the directory
xfreerdp /u:Administrator /p:password123 /v:$IP:$PORT /cert:ignore /drive:linux,/tmp
```

# Rdesktop
[Rdesktop](https://github.com/rdesktop/rdesktop) is an open source client for Microsoft's RDP protocol.
```bash
# Connect with AUTHENTICATION
rdesktop $IP -d local -u Administrator -p 'password123'

# Connect with AUTHENTICATION (mount Linux folder for file transfer)
# connect to \\tsclient\ for accessing the directory
rdesktop $IP -d local -u Administrator -p 'password123' -r disk:linux='/tmp'
```

# Hydra
[Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) is a `parallelized` login cracker which `supports numerous protocols` to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add.

```bash
hydra -L /wordlists.txt/users.txt -P /wordlists/passwords.txt rdp://$IP
```

# Metasploit Framework
[Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) is an open source platform that supports vulnerability research, exploit development, and the creation of custom security tools.

```bash
auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner               # Checks RDP present, (none default port:3389)
auxiliary/scanner/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep        # Checks a range of hosts for the CVE-2019-0708 (bluekeep) vulnerability
exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce  # Exploit bluekeep vulnerability (64 bit)
post/windows/manage/enable_rdp                  # Enabling RDP (post-exploitation)
