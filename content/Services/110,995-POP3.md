The `Post Office Protocol` (**POP**) is a basic email protocol that downloads emails from the server to a local device and typically removes them from the server. It works well for users who access email from a single device but lacks features like email synchronization and folder management.

`Default Port: 110,995(ssl)`

nc -nv $IP 110
openssl s_client -connect $IP:pop3s
```

# Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a network scanner created by [Gordon Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Lyon). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```bash
# Default NSE
sudo nmap -sCV -p110,995 $IP
```

# POP3 Commands

To interact with the POP, use the `telnet` tool to establish a connection with the server.

# Dangerous settings

While most companies use third-party email providers like Google or Microsoft, some still maintain their own mail servers for various reasons.
These settings apply to both POP3 and [[143,993-IMAP|IMAP]] protocols.
