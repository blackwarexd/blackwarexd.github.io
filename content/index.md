Welcome!

I'm thrilled to share my notes on the exciting world of cybersecurity. These notes are packed with insights, techniques, and tools I've picked up along my learning journey.

I'll do my best to keep everything accurate and include some examples to show how the techniques work.
Feel free to dive in, learn, and use what you find here.
