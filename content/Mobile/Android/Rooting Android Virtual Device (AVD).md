By default, the AVD does not come pre-rooted, so you need to root it yourself. Thanks to newbit for developing [rootAVD](https://gitlab.com/newbit/rootAVD), a script that makes rooting the emulator easy.

You can verify the emulatorâ€™s root status using `Android Debug Bridge` (**ADB**), which comes preinstalled with Android Studio as part of the Android SDK Platform-Tools package.

> [!tip]
> ADB can be found at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\sdk\platform-tools` on Windows.

Since running `su` results in a `Permission denied` error, this confirms that the emulator is not rooted.

## Rooting the Emulator

To begin the rooting process, you need **rootAVD**. If you havenâ€™t downloaded it yet, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/newbit/rootAVD.git
```

Run the following command to list all available system images:

```powershell
.\rootAVD.bat ListAllAVDs
```

Since I'm on Windows, Iâ€™ll run the .bat file.

Next, select and copy the command corresponding to the image file your emulator is currently running (**make sure the AVD is running**). In my case, the command is:

> [!note]
> In the highlighted box above, you'll notice that there's the same image (Android 30) but for the Google Play Store API.
>
> **YES!** You can also root an emulator with Google Play Store.

Run the selected command:

```powershell
.\rootAVD.bat system-images\android-30\google_apis\x86\ramdisk.img
```

At some point, you'll be prompted to select a Magisk version for installation.

Press **ENTER** to install the stable version, or wait a moment, as the script will proceed automatically. This isnâ€™t a big deal unless you want a different version.

Once the patching is complete, the AVD will automatically shut down. If it doesnâ€™t, you may need to shut it down manually (though this is rare).

After shutting down, restart the emulator. You should see a new app called **Magisk** installed. Next, open the **Magisk** app. It will prompt you with a message saying, **"Requires Additional Setup."** Click **OK**.

Then, youâ€™ll be asked to choose a method of installation. Select **"Direct Install"**, and then click the **Reboot** button.

## Verifying Root Access

To grant root permissions:
1. Open an ADB shell and run:

```bash
adb shell
su
```

![[adb-shell-run-su-command.png]]

2. A **Superuser Request** prompt will appear on the emulator. Click **GRANT**.

Congratulations! Your emulator is now successfully rooted. ðŸŽ‰
